1. Open your terminal. I recommend using \[Hyper\]\(https://hyper.is/\).

2. Type \`cash -h\`

3. You should see a help message. If it doesn't work, \[please check if you installed this tool correctly\]\(https://github.com/xxczaki/cash-cli/wiki/Installation\), run \`npm update -g cash-cli\` or just \[create an issue\]\(https://github.com/xxczaki/cash-cli/issues\).
